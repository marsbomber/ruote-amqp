  #
  # = AMQP Participants
  #
  # The RuoteAMQP::ParticipantProxy allows you to send workitems (serialized as
  # JSON) or messages to any AMQP queues right from the process
  # definition. When combined with the RuoteAMQP::Receiver you can easily
  # leverage an extremely powerful local/remote participant
  # combinations.
  #
  # For local/remote participants The local part of the
  # RuoteAMQP::ParticipantProxy relies on the presence of a
  # RuoteAMQP::Receiver. Workitems are sent to the remote participant
  # and the local part does not normally reply to the engine.  Instead
  # the engine will continue when a reply is received on the
  # 'ruote_workitems' queue (see RuoteAMQP::Receiver).
  #
  # Of course, the standard :forget => true format can be used even
  # with remote particpants and :forget can even be set as a default in
  # the options.
  #
  # A simple way to create a remote participant to act upon workitems
  # is to use the daemon-kit ruote responder.
  #
  # Simple AMQP messages are treated as 'fire and forget' and the flow
  # will continue when the local participant has queued the message
  # for sending. (As there is no meaningful way to receive a workitem
  # in reply).
  #
  # == Configuration
  #
  # AMQP configuration is handled by directly manipulating the
  # values of the +AMQP.settings+ hash, as provided by the AMQP
  # gem. No AMQP defaults are set by the participant.
  #
  # == Usage
  #
  # Define the queue used by an AMQP participant :
  #
  #   engine.register_participant(
  #     :delete_user, RuoteAMQP::ParticipantProxy, 'queue' => 'user_manager')
  #
  # Sending a workitem to the remote participant defined above:
  #
  #   Ruote.process_definition do
  #     sequence do
  #       delete_user
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Let the local participant reply to the engine without involving
  # the receiver
  #
  #   Ruote.process_definition do
  #     sequence do
  #       delete_user :forget => true
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Setting up the participant in a slightly more 'raw' way:
  #
  #   engine.register_participant(
  #     :amqp, RuoteAMQP::ParticipantProxy )
  #
  # Sending a workitem to a specific queue:
  #
  #   Ruote.process_definition do
  #     sequence do
  #       amqp :queue => 'test', 'command' => '/run/regression_test'
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  # Setup a 'fire and forget' participant that always replies to the
  # engine:
  #
  #   engine.register_participant(
  #     :jfdi, RuoteAMQP::ParticipantProxy, 'forget' => true )
  #
  # Sending a message example to a specific queue (both steps are
  # equivalent):
  #
  #   Ruote.process_definition do
  #     sequence do
  #       amqp :queue => 'test', :message => 'foo'
  #       amqp :queue => 'test', :message => 'foo', :forget => true
  #     end
  #   end
  #
  #
  # == AMQP notes
  #
  # The participant currently only makes use of direct
  # exchanges. Possible future improvements might see use for topic
  # and fanout exchanges as well.
  #
  # The direct exchanges are always marked as durable by the
  # participant, and messages are marked as persistent by default (see
  # #RuoteAMQP)
  #
  class ParticipantProxy

    # The following parameters are used in the process definition.
    #
    # An options hash with the same keys to provide defaults is
    # accepted at registration time (see above).

    #   nil by default.
    # * :forget => (bool) Whether the flow should block until the remote
